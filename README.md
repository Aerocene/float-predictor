# Aerocene Float Predictor

Aerocene is a multidisciplinary endeavor that devises new modes of sensitivity, reactivating a common imaginary towards achieving an ethical collaboration with the atmosphere and the environment. Its activities manifest in the testing and dissemination of lighter-than-air sculptures that become buoyant only by the heat of the Sun and infrared radiation from the surface of Earth. 

The Aerocene Float Predictor is a global forecasting system that utilises open meteorological data to predict flight paths of aerosolar powered Sculptures circling around the globe without CO2 emissions. Incorporating real-time information from 16-day forecasts of wind speeds at different altitudes, the Float Predictor is a navigational tool used to plan journeys in the Aerocene epoch.
